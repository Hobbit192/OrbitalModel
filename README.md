------------------------------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOAD ----------------------------------------------------------------
- Download the file "orbiter.zip"
- Extract the zip file
- Find the exe file: dist/Orbiter/Orbiter.exe
- If you are on mac, the exe won't work, but you might be able to download local copies of everything in this directory and it will maybe work (haven't tested it). I'm working on getting a dmg for mac so the program can just be run from one file.
- Run and enjoy!

------------------------------------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE --------------------------------------------------------------------

- The currently loaded setup contains 9 bodies of mostly similar mass that you can play around with. The "new body" button currently doesn't work (sorry), so if you want to add new bodies or change the scenario you have to do it directly through the code by downloading your own local copy of the files. Some examples are listed in "Scenarios.txt". Support for loading scenarios via json and creating your own coming soon.
- This isn't on the controls page but using 1 and 2 will speed up and slow down the time rate of the simulation.
